Training a Custom NER Model with spaCy\n","\n","  This notebook contains our code to train custom named-entity recognition (NER) models. We trained one NER model with 2 custom tags: \"SELECT\" or \"CONSTRAINT\". \"SELECT\" words are attributes that need to be selected. \"CONTRAINT\" words are values that limit the number of records to be selected. For instance, in \"WHERE player = Paul Seiler\", \"Paul Selier\" is the constraint. We also trained another NER model that supports aggregate function tagging, that is,  it supports the following custom tags: \"COUNT SELECT\", \"AVG SELECT\", \"SUM SELECT\", \"MIN SELECT\", \"MAX SELECT\", \"SELECT\". Thus, this model identifies which select attributes are associated with an aggregate function. The outputs of this notebook currently reflect our training process for the aggregate NER model. The notebook requires functions from the sqlExtract class.  It also assumes spaCy is already installed as spaCy comes pre-installed in the Google Colab environment.\n","\n","  Note: change file paths wherever appropriate to avoid errors.\n","\n","  References:\n","\n","\n","*   [Custom NER with spaCy v3 Tutorial by 1littlecoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_7hJvl7P2A)\n","\n","*   [Training Pipelines and Models - spaCy Documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/training)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WAR0xnt9hgAO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Setup\n","\n","Mount this notebook so that it can access Google Drive."],"metadata":{"id":"ZHfVAL8_pCEX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"Vb_TysEKQDan","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702515274849,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":13691,"user":{"displayName":"Nithisha Kumar","userId":"08606488440343317044"}},"outputId":"efb84335-8188-448e-e047-bdd9b7596a5e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Verify that the notebook is connected to a premium Colab GPU - either a V100 or an A100."],"metadata":{"id":"isNBRmaKpN6w"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["gpu_info = !nvidia-smi\n","gpu_info = '\\n'.join(gpu_info)\n","if gpu_info.find('failed') >= 0:\n","  print('Not connected to a GPU')\n","else:\n","  print(gpu_info)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VGG7s_-Dh4uc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1702515276525,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":140,"user":{"displayName":"Nithisha Kumar","userId":"08606488440343317044"}},"outputId":"20c04dee-7009-41de-98a1-c0961f952fdf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Thu Dec 14 00:54:35 2023       \n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 525.105.17   Driver Version: 525.105.17   CUDA Version: 12.0     |\n","|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.
